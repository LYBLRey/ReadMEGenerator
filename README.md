# README Generator

## Sareybodd Chhorn

​

- Motivation for this project was to learn more backend to understand how I could take user input to generate something. Built this project to learn how a README could be generated instead of manually done every time I start a new project. Problem this solves is figuring out how to template a readme and saves time creating one. I learned how to use javascript better from this.
